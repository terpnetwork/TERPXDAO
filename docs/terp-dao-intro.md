# DAO’s & SubDAO’s: TerpNET

This quick document introduces decentralized contribution DAO, TerpNET. As part of our ongoing efforts to build a robust and experiened coorporative network of peers, we are preparing to instantiate two new sub-DAOs, alongside our main TestNET DAO.

### What is a DAO & SubDAO? (source: [link](https://docs.daodao.zone/docs/introduction/what-is-dao))

**At its simplest, a DAO is an organization where you can vote on proposals.** Proposals are written to an immutable, public ledger (blockchain) - their text, whether they passed or failed, and who voted on them. Proposals can be natural language rules or laws *(for example, you could run a legislature with them)*, or they can be software.

The DAO's governance can itself be modified by governance proposals. For example, **the voting rules of the DAO themselves** (e.g., how long voting periods last, what proportion of people need to vote on something for it to pass, etc.) **can be modified by governance proposals**.

## TestNET DAO’s

### A - TerpNET TestNET DAO

The TerpNET TestNET DAO was instantiated by the governance of our test network and involves two participants, @xiti and @returniflost. This DAO serves as the backbone of our testing efforts.

### B - Genesis-Prep Sub-DAO

Instantiated by the TestNET-DAO, the **Genesis-Prep Sub-DAO** serves a crucial role in our preparations for mainnet launch. It serves to hold consensus of items discussed and decided upon in the lead up to mainnet, having a chance to test inital parameters for a smooth transition to a fully operational network.

### C - Scavenger-Hunt Sub-DAO

Finally, the Scavenger-Hunt Sub-DAO was instantiated by the TestNET DAO and serves to verify participation within the Terp Network Test Nets. By participating in scavenger hunts, members can demonstrate their involvement and commitment to the development of our network.

## MainNET DAO’s

Currently, a Dao of members volunteering to contributions exist on Juno Network. These plans help us map out the next steps moving forward to ensure we can maximize the next steps, while aiming to minimize individual contributors risk as much as possible.

### A - Root-DAO

The Root-DAO is the final layer of consensus for Treasury actions and TerpNET Foundation managerial actions. With a pledge to progressively decentralize, the Root-DAO is committed to achieving a minimum of 2x consensus involvement in the CoreDAO by Q1 2024 and onboarding a non-profit by the same time. This DAO will serve as the cornerstone of our decentralized network, ensuring that the interests of our community are well represented.

### B - Validation-SubDAO

The Validation-SubDAO is initially comprised of validators participating in the Main Network Genesis. These validators have pledged to keep the network secure during its initial infancy and growth by maintaining uptime reliability and adopting slashing-resistant practices.

### C - App-Integration-SubDAO

The App-Integration-SubDAO is focused on development and is comprised of contributors with skillsets in permissionless web application engineering or team leadership roles. This sub-DAO serves as the focal point for funding logic integration into various projects the Foundation is participating in.

### D - Design-SubDAO

The Design-SubDAO is open to all creative direction growth leaders and serves as a platform for appointing management and funding design projects. Whether you're a seasoned designer or just starting out, this sub-DAO provides an opportunity for you to evolve the platform our DAO can become for all artists & creators.

Every time a new subdao is instantiated, it should always have a documentation link provided within the creation proposal similar to this one, communicating thoroughly on the intentions, roles & MVPS of involvement.
